        <h1>Welcome to my temporary website</h1>
        <h2>A short introduction about me</h2>
        
         <p>I am a junior at Bob Jones University studying visual studies. It's basically a general art major. 
             I enjoy learning new ways to create art and I am excited for next year when I get to take many different art classes.</p>
         <p>
            I am from Palau, Micronesia. I was born in Seattle, WA and raised in Palau. That means I have dual citizenship. 
            I attend Omekulel a Biblia er a Belau Church. "Omekulel a biblia" means anchor to the bible in my language, Palauan. 
            Since I am far away from home, I watch the live services that they post on facebook every Sunday. 
            Here is the link to their page: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OBBCPalau">website</a>
